Handle ruby_parser errors.

Write a spec to directly test RatCatcherApp.rename_variable

Refactor rename_variable to use general object invocation protocol
(i.e., get rid of the wrapper on RatCatcherApp)

We don't signal any kind of error if the refactoring is completely
unimplemented.

Clean up the refactoring-object creation in RatCatcherStore#apply
